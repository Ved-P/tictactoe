# Tic Tac Toe

A minimax AI to play the game Tic Tac Toe.

This is a python program that creates a minimax AI to play the game of Tic Tac Toe. It contains two files: `runner.py`, which is a pre-written code for the GUI, and `tictactoe.py`, which contains methods that I have implemented to run the AI.

This project has been assigned by Harvard's CS50 course on Artificial Intelligence.
